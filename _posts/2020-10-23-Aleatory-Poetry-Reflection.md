## The Randomness of Aleoatory Poetry

This week's lesson showed me that right when I thought I was getting a handle on coding, something new would be thrown my way. The element of randomness created bu aleatory poetry was completely unexpected- which I think is the point. Considering the care and specificity involved in creating code correctly, it was interesting to see how it could be used to create a product that gave up that control. For this week's real life example, I sifted through the Twitter bot examples. While most of them were simple repetition of different text symbols, the [soft landscapes](https://twitter.com/softlandscapes) and the [Happnin' in Hastings](https://twitter.com/What_Hastings) were by far my favorite because of their creativity. With the color shifts and various designs, the landscape bot showcased that aleoatory text isn't limited to symbols. I'd be interested in learning what other aspects of visual media can produce. The Happnin' in Hastings account also provied a new perspective on just how random the bots can be. Creating whole sentences like that must require an extensive Tracery grammar. All of the accounts showcase a wide variety of uses for Tracery, and I wonder if a similar method could be applied to other social media app (although it probably already has been). 

I also have a hunch that the Rudder tower Twitter account may be one of these bots.
