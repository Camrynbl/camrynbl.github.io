## Taking the first steps

This week I began building my repository for my website, [COVID-19 Information for Students by a Student](https://camrynbl.github.io/COVID-19-Info-For-Students-by-a-Student/). While my proposal listed my first step as "Create a repository, then implement color scheme and major design elements such as navigation bar and important resources bottom banner," however, I found it was easier to begin with the bare bones of a page or "post" to help develop the design. Given that I am still learning how to work CSS and stylesheets, it is easier to work with a set of text and use a trial-an-error method to build my design. Now that I have written part of my text for the "Testing" page I can better visualize how I want the layout to be organized.

I also noted Dr. Pilsch's critiques and worries over legalities. Therefore, I have already added a disclaimer to the welcome page that makes it clear that my website is not affiliate with any Texas A&M University System parties, nor is my webpage a source of medical instruction or advice. I'm sure this statement will be adjusted going forward, but having that already though hopefully makes it clear that the webpage is *for* A&M students, but not *by* A&M. I have also adjusted the plan for my color scheme, by heavily relying on the green and blue tones rather than the maroon to make it clear that the website is its own separate entity. Now finding a way to implement specific colors into the stylesheet is my next problem to overcome.

Overall, I am happy with the progress I have made so far. I know the time consuming part of the work will be writing the text and inserting all of the hyperlinks. Its imperative to me that all the information is backed up by reputable resources. I also anticipated facing issues with the stylesheet and I'm hoping to find an instructional page that could help me work with primer to implement different colors and structures. As another suggestion from Dr. Pilsch was to create a more "fun" section of the site, rather than having be strictly informational. I originally did want to include a similar section in my webpage, but I was worried it would be to much additional work and I wouldn't be able to get to it before the deadline. But I hope to be able to implement a section for that which may include links to fun face masks or coverings, books and movies I've been enjoying, etc. Since the page is student created, I don't see anything wrong with throwing a bit of more entertaining aspects into the website. 

Before next week, I hope to have the color design implemented and the navigation bar up and running. Perhaps I'll even find a way to insert the "Important Resources" banner at the bottom of the page. I wish there was some kind of guide for specific design choices, but I'm struggling to find help in the [primer origin page](https://github.com/pages-themes/primer).
