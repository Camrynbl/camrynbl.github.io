## A Tracery Grammar Short Story

### The Ghost and the Zombie

A shy spector roamed through calm suburban streets as dusk settled ovet the roofs on Halloween. Children were putting on costumes and neighbors were preparing their bowls of candy for the excited #costumes# and #costumes# that would soon arrive. Ghost was hoping to be much scarier than last year, but was worried their shyness may get in the way once again. Ghost loved coming into the human world to be spooky by walking through walls and appearing suddenly in the shadows. However, Ghost was feeling scared themselves, for what if they are not spooky enough?

"Hello, #ghostname#. Are you ready for another Halloween?" a scratchy voice said behind Ghost. 

Ghost turned around to find Zombie, who was looking very scary in their torn cloths and sunken face.

"Oh hello #zombiename#. I'm very excited for this year's batch of trick-or-treaters. I think I have a good chance at scaring some of the new kids in town." Ghost said with a hopeful smile. 

"What? Those kids are so easy to scare! One look at my face and they go running home!" Zombie bragged. Zombie felt much more terrifying than Ghost, as they looked the spookiest out of the pair.

Ghost knew this was true, but hoped that their unique abilities would give them and advantage. In a moment of courage, Ghost said, "I bet I can scary #kid adjective# Tommy better than you can #zombiename#."

Zombie was shocked by #ghostname# bold statement. Out of all the kids in the neighborhood, #kid adjective# Tommy was the most difficult to spook. 

"#ghostname#, you couldn't scare a fly! You're too shy! I have a much scarier face and voice! I'll take that bet." #zombiename# said confidently.

So the two scary figures began their mission to find #kid adjective# as the evening turned dark and kids poured out of their houses. Zombie slowly stalked around, as one of their legs was broken and roughly dragged behind them. Zombie's appearance was terrifying to the children, but they were slow to catch up to the sugar-fueled kids. Ghost could move through the streets much faster without a body to hold them back, but had a soft "boo" and wasn't able to easily appear to the children in the bright front porch lights of the houses. Both #zombie name# and #ghost name# scared as many kids as they could into the arms of their non-believing parents, but neither could scare Tommy. 

This year, #kidadjective# was dressed as a Royal Knight, complete with a (plastic) sword and shield. Tommy was taller than most of the kids in the neighborhood and prided himself on be the bravest of the bunch. He would knock on the doors of the creepiest houses and lead other kids through the darker streets. As #kid adjective# Tommy made his annuel route through the neighborhood, Ghost and Zombie struggled to scare him. Zombie couldn't keep up with such a tall kid and Ghost didn't have the courage to scare him in such loud way like Zombie would.

"This kid is too fast! How am I supposed to scare him if I can't even catch him!" Zombie exclaimed. 

"Even when you catch him, Tommy is too brave to spook!" Ghost replied.

The two thought about what more they could do. Tommy was leaving one home and looked to be planning to cross the street. This part of the neighborhood was dimly lit, so Ghost thought it may be a good place to appear. Yet, Ghost still had no idea what to actully do once they were there. Ghost drifted over to the young boy with low spirits. 

#adjective# Tommy confidently walked off the edge of the sidewalk and into the dark street. Ghost floated around around him, but Tommy only shivered and moved away from the ghostly figure. Ghost saw that the boy became uneasy, but not scared. However, #adjective# Tommy moved towards Zombie, who was still making their way down the sidewalk. Ghost suddenly had an idea.

Tommy walked down the dark road and away from the cold breeze of Ghost prescence. Ghost used this to direct #adjective# Tommy to Zombie while uttering quite "boos." The young boy was clearly uncomfortable and rubbed his arms to keep away the shivers. Distracted, Tommy was suddenly face-to-face with Zombie. See the scarred face, torn clothes, and thin skin, Tommy screamed in horror. Throughouly spooked, #adjective# Tommy ran down the street and into the bright lights of his home. 

Ghost and Zombie laughed as the terrified boy ran into his parents arms.

"Well it looks like #adjective# Tommy can be scared after all!" Ghost said with glee.

"We should have done that from the start! I guess we've learned that two heads are better than one!" Zombie responded. 

With Halloween coming to an end, Ghost and Zombie left the nieghborhood awaiting the next time the can haunt the streets together again.
