## Where are my files?

This weeks lesson provided with the much needed technique of what I would call "rough draft-ing" for my GitHub repository. I learned on the first day of class that the wait time for your blog to reload small incremental changes that, for the most part, don't do anything (see my last reflection for reference). Utilizing the branch feature to experiement on specific features provides me with the opportunity to mess up the code as much as possible and not have the consequences displayed to the world on my master branch. I also feel as though naming my commits will be much more useful in these smaller branches because I won't be sorting through hundreds of changes like on my master branch.

Mostly importantly, I was able to fix my blog's issue of repeating the content! Utilizing the history feature to search through my commits was a huge help in finding the repeated code. Now my blog looks more purposefully organized. 

I am also currently going through the process of cloning my page so that wait time completely diminishes, but it is still a work in progress.
