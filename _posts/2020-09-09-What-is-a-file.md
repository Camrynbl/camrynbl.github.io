# What is a file? #

For this weeks hands-on activity, I created an About Me page that had a page about my recent [study abroad](/_posts/About-Me/Italy/2020-09-09-My-Short-Trip-to-Italy.md) to Italy. At the suggestion of including travel photos, I thought that it would be wonderful to take a trip down memory lane and create a place to hold all of my photos. 

However, this process did end up being a bit difficult as the funtion to embed photos into a post doesn't seem to be working properly for myself or my other classmates. I attempted to creat a root folder to hold the images at the suggestion of [this Jekyll information page](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/#including-images-and-resources) or possibly downloading a [plug-in](https://nhoizey.github.io/jekyll-postfiles/). Instead I chose to bypass those methods and use my photos to my Instagram account becasue the website provides embed text for each post. With that in mind, my page include three photos: My roommates and myself at the Trevi Fountain in Rome, myself standing in front of the Tower of Pisa, and a picture at an Ice Bar in Rome. While this method did prove to be much more streamline than adding the JPG photos into the page, I do wish that the feature would have worked so that I could include more photos that are not on my Instagram account.
