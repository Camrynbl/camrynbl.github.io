## A Severe Lack of Style ##

Unfortunately, the lessons of this week have not seemed to set in with me, because I have been trying *for hours* to get my navigation bar to look different in anyway, let alone move it to the left side of my blog page like I had originally planned. It is now four a.m. and I've officially given up on making my blog look stylish. I guess GitHub just doesn't want my blog to look nice. What a shame. 

So my conclusion as of now, is that this will have to wait for another day. However, it is now officially October for me so Happy Spooky Season everyone.
