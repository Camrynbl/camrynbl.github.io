# Introduction #
Howdy! My name is Camryn Lang and I'm from Boerne, Texas. I am currently a senior English major with a communication minor. I'm one of three Aggies in my family and the last to make it through as I go into my final semester. I love to listen to a variety of music, but if I had to pick, Saint Motel is my favorite band. 

I have wanted to take this course for a few semesters, so I’m excited that it’s finally being offered again. My goal is to work for a book publisher as an editor, but I know that I won’t be getting a position like that right away. I think that digital content could be the next best thing. Taking this course will allow me to pursue that.
