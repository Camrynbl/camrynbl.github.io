## What is Data Activity

**Team Member Card**

The Card Picker seems to be utilizing dictionary compound data, in which several keys are linked a specific scalar data. Therefore, the team members name serving as the scalar data is linked to four keys: job title, phone number, location, job description, and a photo. I think the Card Picker visualization is closest to the tree diagram visualizer, because after selecting one name, an new path stemming only from that name is shown on the screen. Since the list of people in the team is not very long, I believe this method of visulizing the data works well because the user is able to easily identify the name they are looking for and select it to gain more information on that specific person. However, if the team was much larger, say twenty people, this method would be less effective as the names would become more difficult to find. In that case, using the Circle Packing visulizer might be more beneficial as it groups like items together by more than just name and position in the intital categorization. 

**The Demographics of Others**

The Demographics of Others vizualization utilizes a database that collects and organizes different scalar data based on multiple different correlations. The demographics data inlcudes gender, age group, and race or origin and breaks them down into several categories. This suggests that the data is based on several dictionaries becasue each particular group has several keys. The visualizer organizes this with a pie chart (just square one). The method is great for showing a direct comparison of a group within several categories. The only disadvantage to this version is that, with the amount of data being displayed, there's visual chaos. The chart may be difficult to interpret. Using a visualizer like a radial column chart may make it more distinct when there are large differences between the groups. 

**Based on a True Story**

At its most basic form, the movie comparisons are shown with timestamps for each scene of a movie with a color designating a specific meaning. This scalar is sorted as list data which provides a specific integer with a color. However, the website goes further by providing dictionary based data. When clicking on a designated scene the website provides four keys: the movie scene's description, the real event's description, a link to the source of the event's description, and a photo. This form of visualizing data is highly effective for this information, because users can see an overall representation of the movies accuracy and then view the individual scene's information, ultimately showcasing the whole and its parts. It would have been to the website's disadvantage to have the list data displayed as a pie graph, which is typically used to show parts of a whole, because they would have to list the individuals scene's information seperately. In addition, the website is able to create a linear timeline that matches with the movie and easy for the user to recognize as a the timeline of the movie.
