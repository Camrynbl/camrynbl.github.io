In the spring semester of 2020, I was signed up to attend a study abroad in Castiglion Fiorentino. It's a very small town in Tuscany, Italy and where myself and around thirty other students lived and learned from Febuary 2nd to March 4th. While I know that everyone who goes on a study abroad seemingly can't stop talking about it when they return to the United States, I understand why. It was one of the best experiences of my life, even though it was cut short by the pandemic. Here's a collection of pictures from my time there.
